## Unix Exercises

1. Navigate to your home directory

2. Create a new file called `my_file.txt` (hint: use the command `touch`)

3. Make a new directory call `dir`

4. *Move* your newly created file `my_file.txt` to the new directory (do this from your home directory)

5. Navigate to this new directory, and enter the command `pwd`. 

6. Now make a duplicate copy of this file named `my_duplicate_file.txt` which should be stored in home directory itself

7. Open this file in a text editor (either a GUI or in your terminal). Type something exciting in the file (or just copy/paste some stuff into the file), spanning several lines, and then save/close the file.

8. Use the command `wc` to determine the number of lines in your file.

9. Use the command `grep` to find which lines contain a letter/symbol/number/phrase of your choosing.

10. Delete the file `my_file.txt`.

11. Create another new directory called `a new directory`. Now enter the command `ls`. What do you see?

12. Remove the directory(ies) created under #11.

13. Use the commands `grep` and `history` (possibly with arguments!) to figure out how many times you've used the command `cd` recently.

14. Define a new variable called "variable" and assign it the value 5

15. Print this variable to stdout (hint: use the command `echo`)

16. Pipe the contents of this variable to a new file called `newfile.txt`

17. Create a new directory called "new", and navigate to this directory

18. In a *single line* of code, create three new files called `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.csv`. Use the command `ls` to confirm that these files were created.

19. *FROM THIS DIRECTORY* (important!), enter the command `rm *.txt`, and then enter `ls`. What remains in the directory? What is missing from the directory?

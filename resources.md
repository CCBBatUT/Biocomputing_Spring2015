# Recommended resources
---

1. We strongly recommend the book [**Practical Computing for Biologists**](http://practicalcomputing.org) by Haddock and Dunn. The book provides a really thorough overview of most of what we'll learn in this class (including Unix, Python, R, , and more! The book's accompanying website (http://practicalcomputing.org) is also regularly maintained with important tips, examples, and errata.

2. The [**UNIX Tutorial for Beginners**](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) is a great resource and starting point for getting comfortable with the command-line environment.

3. Don't forget your most valuable resource: google! If you encounter an issue, chances are somebody else has also encountered it and has asked about it. Googling your error messages is one of the best debugging strategies there is. In particular, try to find links to the website [**stackoverflow.com**](http://www.stackoverflow.com). This forum-based website has all the answers, possibly literally.

4. ppts, exercises, and cheatsheets from last year's course. [**Wiki**](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/CCBB/Introduction+to+Biological+Computing+Course) [**github**](https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014/tree/master)

5. Great paper on [**Best Practices in Scientific Computing**](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)

###Good coding practices:

* Modular coding, i.e. make each function do one thing and do it well. Itâ€™s easier to compose and test minimal, single-purpose functions.
* Test a function/line of code before you write another one!
* Comment a lot and add doc strings once you have a functioning function. Future you will be so happy.
* Use informative names for your variables. Function names should be verbs while instances should be nouns or noun phrases. In general, avoid short abbreviations. Single letters (i, n, ...) are typically reserved for counting variables.
* Once you're a seasoned python-er, keep your style up to standard by reading 'best practices' (see Lesson)


###Ways to test your code:

#####1. If you're working with large files, use a reduced file to test your code, or only test one file at first. 
```
head -1000 largeDataFile.csv > test.csv 
```
``` python
function_name('file1.txt')
```

#####2. As you're writing functions, use print to check that your output is what you expect.
```python
import os

def make_filelist(directory, file_ending):
	"""This function makes a list of files with a certain ending in a certain directory.
	"""
	
	files=os.listdir(directory)
	files_pdb=[]
	for file in files:
		if file.endswith(file_ending):
			files_pdb.append(file)
	print files
	print files_pdb
	return files_pdb

make_filelist('.', '.pdb')
```
#####3. Python's assert clause allows you to test a comparison and exits the script if not true. You can have it print an error message upon exiting.

```python
assert a == b, "Error: comparison %s == %s is false" %(value1,value2)

def sum_num(num_list):
	totalSum=0
	for item in num_list:
		assert type(item)==int, "Uh oh, item '%s' not the right type! Exiting now." %item
		totalSum+=item
	print totalSum
	
num_list=[3,52,6,'b',2,463,'a']		
sum_num(num_list)
```

#####4. Python's try-except clauses allow you to trigger error messages for specific types of errors without killing the program.
	
```python

def sum_num(num_list):
	totalSum=0
	for item in num_list:
		try:
			totalSum+=item
		except TypeError:
			print "Warning, item '%s' not the right type! Continuing to next item" %item
	print totalSum
	
num_list=[3,52,6,'b',2,463,'a']		
sum_num(num_list)
```
#####5. Print stdout to a log file when using your computer to check for errors. Everything you 'print' will be appended to the logfile. 

```
python script.py > logfile
```
```python
#### global variable
import time
logfile=open('jobname.log','a') 

def function_name(arguments):

	start=time.clock()
	code doing things
	and other things
	print >>logfile,"%s was parsed in %fs." %(input_file,(time.clock() - start))

function_name(arguments)
```

```python
#### open and close each time
import time

def function_name(arguments):

	start=time.clock()
	code doing things
	and other things
	with open('jobname.log','a') as f:
		f.write("%s was parsed in %fs." %(input_file,(time.clock() - start)))

function_name(arguments)
```
